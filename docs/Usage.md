# Usage Guide

**VBAlidator** is a command-line tool designed to statically analyze VBA code exported from Microsoft Office applications. It simulates the compilation process to detect syntax errors, undefined variables, and type mismatches without requiring the Windows environment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python Package Manager)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/twobeass/VBAlidator.git
   cd VBAlidator
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
   This makes the `vbalidator` command available system-wide (or in your virtual environment).

## Running the Tool

You can run the tool using the `vbalidator` command.

```bash
vbalidator [options] <input_folder>
```

### Alternative Usage (Module Execution)

If you prefer not to install the package or are developing the tool, you can execute it directly as a Python module from the root directory:

```bash
python -m src.main [options] <input_folder>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `input_folder` | **Required.** Positional argument. Path to the directory containing your exported `.bas`, `.cls`, and `.frm` files. |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message and exit. |
| `--define` | Conditional Compilation constants. Format: `KEY=VALUE,KEY2=True`. |
| `--model` | Path to a custom JSON Object Model file. If omitted, the tool looks for `vba_model.json` in the current directory. |
| `--output` | Path to save the structured JSON report (default: `vba_report.json`). |

### Examples

#### Basic Check
Check all files in the `export` folder. If `vba_model.json` exists in the current directory, it will be used.
```bash
vbalidator ./export
```

#### Conditional Compilation
Simulate a 64-bit environment.
```bash
vbalidator ./export --define "Win64=True,VBA7=True"
```

#### Custom Object Model
Use a specific object model definition generated by the exporter.
```bash
vbalidator ./export --model ./custom_model.json
```

### Running the Demo
A `demo/` folder is included to showcase the tool's capabilities. It contains files with intentional errors.

```bash
vbalidator ./demo
```

Expected output includes:
*   Undefined variables (`x`, `unknown_var`)
*   Duplicate declarations (`Dim y`)
*   Invalid constant initialization (`Const InvalidConst = UndefinedConstant`)
*   Invalid procedure calls (`res = z(10)`)
*   Missing members (`Me.InvalidMethod`, `i.SomeMethod`)

### What is NOT Covered
While VBAlidator is a powerful static analysis tool, it is not a full VBA compiler. Some compile-time and run-time errors may not be detected:

*   **Late Binding:** Calls to objects declared as `Object` or `Variant` are not validated.
*   **Complex Flow Analysis:** Uninitialized variables (used before assignment) or complex `GoTo` logic (jumping into blocks) are not fully analyzed.
*   **Runtime Logic:** Errors like "Division by zero" or "Index out of bounds" are runtime errors and are outside the scope of static analysis.

## Output

The tool provides two types of output:

1.  **Console Output:** Colored logs indicating the file, line number, and error message.
    ```
    Module1.bas:10: Undefined identifier 'MyVar' in 'MySub'.
    ```

2.  **JSON Report:** A machine-readable report saved to the specified output path.
    ```json
    {
      "summary": {
        "files_scanned": 5,
        "issues_found": 1
      },
      "issues": [
        {
          "file": "Module1.bas",
          "line": 10,
          "message": "Undefined identifier 'MyVar' in 'MySub'."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
